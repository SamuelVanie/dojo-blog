## Running the project

### Server

- To be able to run the project you will have to run a json web server before
- The project uses a file called db.json that constitutes in this case the database

To do that run the command `npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000`

### Frontend

To run the frontend you can do it like any reactjs project.

`npm start` is a possibility.
